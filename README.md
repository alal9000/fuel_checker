# Introduction:
Hi, my name is Aaron Lal from Sydney, Australia and I am proud to be submitting my cs50w capstone project called "Fuel Checker". This readme document is split into 7 sections, each of which explain the application in greater detail. Feel free to jump forward to any particular section in which you are interested. 

## 0. Project Title:
Fuel Checker

## 1. Project Description: 
This application does exactly what is says on the box, it is a fuel price checker! With the cost of living so extraordinary high these days, especially energy and fuel, I wanted to create an application that would save the user money when they decided to fill up their tank. With fuel stations changing their prices daily, it is near impossible to ascertain where the cheapest location to fill up is. You can't really drive around to find the cheapest stations as that would waste fuel. Thats where the fuel checker application comes in. By utilizing technology and the power of APIs it is able to return real time fuel data to the user including; price, address and station name within a radius that is specified (currently configured to within 2km of their current location). This then will enable the user to check the fuel prices for ALL stations within their current geographical vicinity for 91 unleaded fuel.

## 2. How to Run the Application:
The application requires an API security token to be generated from the NSW fuel API prior to use. The secuirty token is in the form of a string (such as Hytksdhys75fdnbnmdskhj#2) and is only valid for 48 hours. Due to this by the time my capstone project is assessed the latest security token would liekly be invalid, for this reason the user would need to navigate to https://api.nsw.gov.au/  

## 3. How to Use the Application:

## 4. Distinctiveness and Complexity:

This application makes use of two seperate external APIs. The first is google maps API and the second is the NSW fuel API.

## 5. File Structure and Contents:

## 6. Supplementary Infomation:

# Conclusion:
