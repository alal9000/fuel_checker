# Introduction:
Hi, my name is Aaron Lal from Sydney, Australia and I am proud to be submitting my cs50w capstone project called "Fuel Checker". This readme document is split into 7 sections, each of which explain the application in greater detail. Feel free to jump forward to any particular section in which you are interested. 

## 0. Project Title:
Fuel Checker

## 1. Project Description: 
This application does exactly what is says on the box, it is a fuel price checker! With the cost of living so extraordinary high these days, especially energy and fuel, I wanted to create an application that would save the user money when they decided to fill up their tank. With fuel stations changing their prices daily, it is near impossible to ascertain where the cheapest location to fill up is. Thats where the fuel checker application comes in. It uses real time data 



will enable the user to check the fuel prices for 91 unleaded fuel within their local vicinity.
